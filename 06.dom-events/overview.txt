DOM events allows us to react to user actions and thus to create a better user experience.

We can create (a new element), remove(existing element) and append(create a new element at append it
or take an element from one place and append it to another).

document.createElement() - is a factory method

When we create an element, we create it in memory. 
Only after we append it to the DOM, then it becomes part of the tree.

The variable hold a reference to the element that is in the tree. If we change the element
by reference, the change will be reflected into the DOM tree.

methods:
- parentElement.append(child1, child2)
- parentElement.removeChild(child)
- childElement.remove()
- parentElement.prepend()
- parentElement.replaceWith()
- parentElement.replaceAll()
- parentElement.replaceChildren()
- childElement.closest()
- childElement.replace()
