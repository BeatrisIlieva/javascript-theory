DOM events allows us to react to user actions and thus to create a better user experience.

We can create (a new element), remove(existing element) and append(create a new element at append it
or take an element from one place and append it to another).

document.createElement() - is a factory method

When we create an element, we create it in memory. 
Only after we append it to the DOM, then it becomes part of the tree.

The variable hold a reference to the element that is in the tree. If we change the element
by reference, the change will be reflected into the DOM tree.

methods:
- parentElement.append(child1, child2)
- parentElement.removeChild(child)
- childElement.remove()
- parentElement.prepend()
- parentElement.replaceWith()
- parentElement.replaceAll()
- parentElement.replaceChildren()
- childElement.closest()
- childElement.replace()

We can register events and initiate an appropriate action.

Event object holds the information about the event. It is passed as an argument to the function
(event handler) responsible for handling the event. As an object, the vents has properties. 
The properties give us information about, for example, which is the element 
that triggered the event, what is the type of the event 
(mouse-events, keyboard events, touch events, focus events, form events)

Three ways to register an event listener:
1. HTML attribute
2. DOM element property
3. DOM event handler
